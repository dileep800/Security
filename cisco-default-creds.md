Cisco Default Credentials – Keys Under the Doormat

Sometimes bug hunting feels like breaking into Fort Knox. Other times… it feels like finding the keys under the doormat. This was one of those days.

🕵️ Reconnaissance

I was mapping Cisco’s infrastructure and stumbled upon a login panel:

Now, most of the time, these admin panels are locked down tight. But I always test the classics. You never know when someone left the door wide open.

🚀 The “One-Shot” Attempt

I typed in the old faithful:

username: admin
password: admin

Hit enter.

And just like that — full access. No brute forcing, no fancy exploits. The portal rolled out the red carpet.

⚡ Why This Matters

This wasn’t just a random UI — it had access to:

📊 Monitoring dashboards

🛠️ Device configurations

🔐 Sensitive internal data

With this level of access, an attacker could pivot deeper, change configs, or even take systems offline.

🛡️ Remediation

The fix is simple but critical:

Remove default accounts before production deployment.

Enforce strong passwords & MFA for all admin portals.

Audit exposed services regularly.

🎯 Takeaway

Finding this was a reminder that sometimes the scariest bugs aren’t the exotic 0-days — they’re the easy mistakes that slip through the cracks.
